  %\caption{Speedup (Y-axis) with \StaWbar{}, \NaiWbar{}, and \FroWbar{} (dashed lines) along with \StaBarf{}, \NaiBarf{}, and \FroBarf{} (solid lines) with respect to sequential version of the same approach, when performed with increasing number of threads from $1$ to $64$ in multiples of $2$ (X-axis), on a fixed batch size of $10^{-4}|E|$ and in the absence of faults.}
\caption{Time taken by \StaWbar{}, \NaiWbar{}, and \FroWbar{} (dashed lines) along with \StaBarf{}, \NaiBarf{}, and \FroBarf{} (solid lines) over increasing thread count from 1 to 128. The time is averaged over the graphs in Table \ref{tab:dataset}.}
