% Average percentage of affected vertices with \textit{Dynamic Traversal} and \textit{Dynamic Frontier} PageRank, with increasing batch size of $10^{-7} |E|$ to $0.1 |E|$, in multiples of $10$ (logarithmic scale). As the \textit{Dynamic Frontier} approach marks affected vertices incrementally, we plot the percentage of vertices marked as affected at the end of all iterations (i.e., we consider all vertices ever considered as affected).
