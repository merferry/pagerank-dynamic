\subsection{Our Dynamic Frontier approach}
\label{sec:frontier}

The \textit{Naive-dynamic} approach processes all vertices in the graph until convergence. However, if a batch update $\Delta^{t-} \cup \Delta^{t+}$ is small compared to the total number of edges $|E|$, then it is expected that the ranks of only a few vertices change. Our proposed \textit{Dynamic Frontier} approach incorporates this aspect, and identifies affected vertices efficiently via an incremental process. We apply this approach to \textit{With-barrier} and \textit{Barrier-free} PageRank in Algorithms \ref{alg:with-barrier} and \ref{alg:barrier-free}, which we also denote as \FroWbar{} and \FroBarf{} respectively.

% Incremental Iteration Method for Fast PageRank Computation (2015): In this paper, Kim and Choi \cite{kim2015incremental} propose an asynchronous approach for computing PageRank combined with the standard approach for finding the affected set of vertices (like Desikan et al. \cite{rank-desikan05}).


\subsubsection{Explanation of the approach}
\label{sec:frontier-explanation}

Consider a batch update consisting of edge deletions $(u, v) \in \Delta^{t-}$ and insertions $(u, v) \in \Delta^{t+}$. We first initialize the rank of each vertex to that obtained in the previous snapshot of the graph.

\input{src/fig-about-df}

\paragraph{Initial marking of affected vertex on edge deletion/insertion:}

For each edge deletion/insertion $(u, v)$, we initially mark the outgoing neighbors of the vertex $u$ in the previous $G^{t-1}$ and current graph snapshot $G^t$ as affected (lines \ref{alg:with-barrier--mark-begin}-\ref{alg:with-barrier--mark-end} in Algorithm \ref{alg:with-barrier}, and lines \ref{alg:barrier-free--mark-begin}-\ref{alg:barrier-free--mark-end} in Algorithm \ref{alg:barrier-free}).

\paragraph{Incremental marking of affected vertices upon change in rank of a given vertex:}

Next, while performing PageRank computation (lines \ref{alg:with-barrier--compute-begin}-\ref{alg:with-barrier--compute-end} in Algorithm \ref{alg:with-barrier}, and lines \ref{alg:barrier-free--compute-begin}-\ref{alg:barrier-free--compute-end} in Algorithm \ref{alg:barrier-free}), if the rank of any affected vertex $v$ changes in an iteration by an amount greater than the \textit{frontier tolerance} $\tau'$, we mark its outgoing neighbors as affected (lines \ref{alg:with-barrier--remark-begin}-\ref{alg:with-barrier--remark-end} in Algorithm \ref{alg:with-barrier}, and lines \ref{alg:barrier-free--remark-begin}-\ref{alg:barrier-free--remark-end} in Algorithm \ref{alg:barrier-free}). This process of marking vertices continues in every iteration.

\subsubsection{A simple example}

Figure \ref{fig:about-frontier} shows an example of the \textit{Dynamic Frontier} approach. The original graph, shown in Figure \ref{fig:about-frontier-01} consists of $16$ vertices. Subsequently, Figure \ref{fig:about-frontier-02} shows a batch update applied to the original graph involving the deletion of an edge from vertex $2$ to $1$ and the insertion of an edge from vertex $4$ to $12$. Following the batch update, we perform the initial step of the \textit{Dynamic Frontier} approach, marking outgoing neighbors of $2$ and $4$ as affected, i.e., $1$, $3$, $4$, $8$, and $12$ are marked as affected. Note that vertex $2$ is not affected as it is a source of the change while vertex $4$ being a neighbour of $2$ is also affected. Now, we are ready to execute the first iteration of PageRank algorithm.

During the first iteration (see Figure \ref{fig:about-frontier-03}), the ranks of affected vertices are updated. Consider that the change in rank of vertices $1$ and $12$ is observed to be greater than frontier tolerance $\tau'$, shown with red border in Figure \ref{fig:about-frontier-03}. In response to this, the \textit{Dynamic Frontier} approach incrementally marks the outgoing neighbors of $1$ and $12$ as affected, specifically vertices $5$, $11$, and $14$.

During the second iteration (see Figure \ref{fig:about-frontier-04}), the ranks of affected vertices are again updated. Further, consider that the change in rank of vertices $3$, $5$, $11$, and $14$ is observed to be greater than frontier tolerance $\tau'$, shown with red border in Figure \ref{fig:about-frontier-03}. As before, we mark the outgoing neighbors of $3$, $5$, $11$, and $14$ as affected, namely vertices $4$, $6$, and $15$.

In the subsequent iteration, the ranks of affected vertices are again updated. If the change in rank of every vertex is within (iteration) tolerance $\tau$, the ranks of vertices have converged, and the algorithm terminates.




\subsection{Dynamic Frontier With-barrier PageRank (\FroWbar{})}
\label{sec:frontier-withbarrier}

As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:withbarrier}, we perform a synchronous rank computation with \FroWbar{} using two rank vectors $R$, and $R_{new}$ (see Algorithm \ref{alg:with-barrier}).

\paragraph{Tracking affected vertices:}

To track vertices that are marked as affected due to the current batch update $\Delta^{t-} \cup \Delta^{t+}$, we use a flag vector $V_A$ (an 8-bit integer vector).

\paragraph{Detecting convergence:}

Note that $\Delta r$ represents the change in rank of single vertex, and $\Delta R$ represents the $L_\infty$-norm between the previous $R$ and the current rank vector $R_{new}$. When $\Delta R$ lies within (iteration) tolerance $\tau$, ranks are considered to have converged.




\subsection{Determination of Frontier tolerance ($\tau'$)}

Our experiments show that a frontier tolerance of $\tau' = \tau/1000$, where $\tau$ is the (iteration) tolerance, provides a good speedup with a maximum error of $10^{-9}$ at a batch size of $10^{-4} |E|$ compared to a mean error of $5 \times 10^{-10}$ for \NaiWbar{} and \NaiBarf{} with respect to ranks obtained from reference PageRank (see Section \ref{sec:measurement}). Thus, if an edge in the batch update affects the rank of vertex $u$ (by a small amount), directly or indirectly, all its outgoing neighbors $v' \in G^t.out(u)$ will also be marked as affected, as they are likely to have a change in rank as well.

% However, our experiments show that the \textit{Dynamic Traversal} approach does not perform better than the \textit{Naive-dynamic} approach for any batch size. The overhead of this approach, due to several traversals required to identify the affected vertices, limits the performance of this approach.
